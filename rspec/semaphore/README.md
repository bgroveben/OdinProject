This is a tutorial I found at :
https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-rspec.

Open your project's directory in your terminal, and type bundle install --path .bundle 
to install the latest version of RSpec and all related dependencies. 

I added the .rspec file so I could see the pretty colors.

$ bundle exec rspec --format documentation is pretty neat feature.

Finished 'Getting Started with RSpec', next is 'RSpec Subject, Helpers, Hooks, and Exception Handling'.
