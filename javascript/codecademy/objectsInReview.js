// Objects in Review

// There are two basic ways to make objects:
// make spencer here with literal notation
var spencer = {
  age: 22,
  country: "United States"
};

// make spencer2 here with constructor notation
var spencer2 = new Object();
spencer2.age = 22;
spencer2.country = "United States";


// Properties
var snoopy = new Object();
snoopy.species = "beagle";
snoopy.age = 10;
// save Snoopy's age and species into variables
// use dot notation for snoopy's species
var species = snoopy.species;  
// use bracket notation for snoopy's age
var age = snoopy["age"];
