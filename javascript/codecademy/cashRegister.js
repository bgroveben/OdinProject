// Building a Cash Register

// You are working for a large supermarket and the cash register has just failed. 
// The boss is not happy as he can't make any money.
// To save the day it happens that you let slip to your boss that you know JavaScript and can build a 
// quick virtual cash register until head office sends support staff.

// Create the object called cashRegister and initialize its total property to 0
var cashRegister = {
  total: 0    
};
//Using dot notation change the total property
cashRegister.total = 2.99;
