<!-- blockquote and q are used for quotations -->
<p>So I asked Bob about quotations on the Web and he said <q>I know as much about quotations as I do about pigeon fancying</q>. Luckily, I found HTML Dog and it said:</p>


<!-- If the source is on the web, the cite attribute can be used to point to its origin. -->
<blockquote cite="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/text/">
    <p>blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used for standalone often multi-line quotations whereas q is used for shorter, in-line quotations.</p>
</blockquote>


<!-- Blockquotes work well with the HTML5 elements figure and figcaption -->
<figure>
	<blockquote>[Big old quotation about evolution]</blockquote>
	<figcaption>Charles Darwin</figcaption>
</figure>


<!-- Beware cite; there is a cite tag as well as a cite attribute -->
<p>According to <cite>the Bible</cite>, after six days God said <q>Okay, it's time for a nap</q>.</p>


<!-- Computer geekery! code represents computer code, var is used for variables, samp is for sample output, and kbd (keyboard) is for user input-->
<p>If you add the line <code><var>givevaderachuckle</var> = true;</code> to the <code>destroy_planet</code> subroutine and then type <kbd>ilovejabba</kbd> into the console, the big bad green Death Star laser will etch <samp>Slug Lover!</samp> on the planet's surface.</p>


<!-- pre is preformatted text; it is used where spacing, such as indentations, are relevant-->
<pre><code>
&lt;div id="intro"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Some heading&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some paragraph paragraph thing thing thingy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>


<!-- Meta tags -->
<!-- The reason why meta tags used to be so important was because they were relied on by search engines to build a profile of a web page. The keywords meta data was used (and abused) extensively, for example. Nowadays, however, most search engines use the actual content of the page itself. -->

<head>
	<title>HTML tutorial</title>
	<meta charset="utf-8"> 
	<!-- <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3">  #!# This is not a good idea, refreshing the page every 3 seconds -->
	<meta name="description" content="This is my really, really, REALLY exciting web page about air conditioners">
</head>


<!-- Tables: rowspan and colspan -->
<!-- td is a standard data cell, th is a header cell -->
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Column 1 heading</th>
		<th>Column 2 heading</th>
		<th>Column 3 heading</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Row 2 cell 1</td>
		<td colspan="2">Row 2, cell 2, also spanning row 2, cell 3</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="2">Row 3, cell 1, also spanning Row 4, cell 1</td>
		<td>Row 3, cell 2</td>
